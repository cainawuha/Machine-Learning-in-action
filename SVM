# decision function 
g(x)=wx+b
g(xi)>0，then belons to lable C1，if g(xi)<0，then C2.f(x)=sgn [g(x)] is real decision function.
g(x)=wx+b=0 is hyper plane

# function distance
δi=yi(wxi+b)
# geometric distance
δi=yi(wxi+b) / ||w||

# objective function
max δi equal to min ||w|| or min 1/2 w^2, when w=0,get min, but geometric become infinite,
all sample come into margin, that is not we want, so we need add constraint to objective function
that is dataset must exist either side of hyper plane.
yi[(w·xi)+b]≥1

min 1/2 w^2  
subject to yi[(w·xi)+b]≥1 (i is sample amount)

# the core is to resovle w, because xi,yi are all known sample points, when w is resolved, 
then b is also resolved as we can take some sample to calculate it out. and hyper plane 
is also resolved. w is determined by sample datasets, when these datasets are given among 
spaces, then w is fixed. all we need to do is find out the existed w.
use math to express the above, that is:
w=α1x1 + α2x2 +…+ αnxn, xi is sample dataset, while w is alos connected to label, as w will
be changed when some points changed label.
so 
w=α1y1x1 + α2y2x2+…+ αnynxn , most α is 0, as they don't take decisive effect on w,
only these data point with non-zero αn make w fixed. these data points called support vector
