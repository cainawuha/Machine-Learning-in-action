KNN                    high accuracy, insensitive to outliers,no assumptions about data           computationally expensive, require a lot of memory
decision trees         computationally cheap, easy for humans to understand learned results,      prone to overfitting
                        can deal with irrelevant features   
naive Bayes            works with small amount of data, handles multiple classes                  sensitive tp how input data is prepared
